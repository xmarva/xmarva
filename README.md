# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Eva

I'm an AI Engineer and Researcher with a current focus on **Computer Vision** and **Generative AI**. \
Learn more about my approach to AI and work experience on my [personal website](https://xmarva.github.io). 

## üß† My Work Principles

- **Simplify the complex**  
  Aim to explain challenging concepts in plain language, avoiding the dense jargon often found in academic papers.  

- **Avoid unnecessary work**  
  Take the time to assess whether it's truly worth it and how to approach it in the most efficient way possible.  

- **Organize for success**  
  Time spent organizing and maintaining clean code and workflows pays off not just in the long term but immediately.  

- **Respect technological boundaries**  
  Strive to recognize the limits of technology and avoid playing the role of omnipotent creator.  

- **Stay humble**  
  A little less ego goes a long way in achieving better results.
